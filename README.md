# Borderlands2Patcher
Patcher for borderlands2.exe for ability to use community patch. More info about patch: https://youtu.be/o_ee3BM1TQQ 

Repository with custom pathces: https://github.com/BL2CP/community-custom-weapons

Also there is a patched file `engine.upk` for Linux/Mac, instructions: https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/5y35js/community_patch_for_linuxand_probably_mac/
and Syntax Highlighting for Kate Editor. Put `bpf.xml` file to `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\katepart5\syntax` (`~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax` on linux) and restart Kate if you have it launched. If you don't have this directory you can create it or launch update for syntax(`Settings > Configure Kate > Open/Save > Modes & Filetypes > Download Highlighting Files`) and it will create needed dir. It will be used by default for *.bpf files, but you can use it for *.txt files too. It can be on with `Tools > Mode(Highlighting) > Other > Borderlands Patch File`.

If you have any question to me or about mods/modding, you can join Shadow's Discord server and ask https://discord.gg/0YjZxbVBS9b3bXUS
